.Sh SYNOPSIS
.\" FIXME: Other man pages don't need to use \p to break lines here,

.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
utility lists processes running on the system, to the standard
output.
If stdout is a terminal, output will be truncated at
terminal window width.
.Pp
Without any arguments,
.Nm
lists all processes on the system.
.Pp
If you specify a
.Ar filter
the output will contain only processes matching that filter.
.Pp
The
